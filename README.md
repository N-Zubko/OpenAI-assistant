This full-stack interactive and responsive web application is designed to help users find answers related to JavaScript. The answers are short and concise, when required they contain a code template. The user types the question in the input box and hits the button, the question is sent to OpenAI using its API and the answer received by the app will appear in the box below. All question-answer pairs are stored in the database and are displayed in the `/responses` page.

Technology used: ðŸ’¡ React.js for the frontend, ðŸ’¡ Node.js and ðŸ’¡ ExpressJS for the backend, ðŸ’¡ PostgreSQL hosted online as a database, ðŸ’¡ React Bootstrap and vanilla CSS for styling, ðŸ’¡ OpenAI API to obtain answers to your questions ðŸ’¡ Uses GPT-3 Davinci model from OpenAI ðŸ’¡ Live app is deployed on Heroku

## Architecture:

![Structure of the application and relations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63440229/185286128-32209a85-c8d6-4e88-82f1-c1e88c618b92.png)

## How to run the app:

1. clone the repository, install dependencies in the client and server directories. My plan is to improve this part later, as well as deploy the application on a hosting platform.

2. In the command line while in the root enter the following `npm start`. This will launch the application and open it in your browser at port `3002`

## For security:

1. the application has basic authentication form asking the user for a login and password at the start of the application.
The login is `test` and the password is `pass`. No additional registration is required.

2. The API Key is hidden.

## To see the database contents:

Go to `http://localhost:3002/responses`

## Design:

Inspired by the 80-ies aesthetics, hence glowing colours and lots of square patterns.

## How to use:

1. If you want to read all responses stored in the database, go to `/allResponses` or click `Responses` in the navigation bar. If the database is not empty, you will see numbered cards with previously asked questions and answeres.

2. If you want to ask a new question, go to `/question` or select `Question` tab in the navigation bar, type it in the input box and click on the `Get Your Answer` button. The answer will appear in a new box below and will be added to the page with all responses.

## Plans:

1. I would like to improve accessibility of the application

2. Adding automated tests with the React Testing Library is also in my plans

3. Deploy the app on a hosting platform as mentioned earlier

4. Add animation and sounds with an option to turn them off
